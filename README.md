### NoReactions
Prevents reactions from displaying, if you ever find reactions annoying.

### VCID
Allows for voice channel IDs to be copied by long pressing on the channel.

### VideoEmbedPatch
Fixes copying broken video media links from media.discordapp.net, now correctly copies a link to cdn.discordapp.com, allowing it to embed properly when sent. Also now strips the video embed link from messages, so now video embed links will no longer be in the message, much like how embedded images and gifs work.
