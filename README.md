# `Aliucord-plugin`

Plugins repo for [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord)

### NoReactions
Prevents reactions from displaying, if you ever find reactions annoying.

### VCID
Allows for voice channel IDs to be copied by long pressing on the channel.

### VideoEmbedPatch
Fixes copying broken video media links from media.discordapp.net, now correctly copies a link to cdn.discordapp.com, allowing it to embed properly when sent. Also now strips the video embed link from messages, so now video embed links will no longer be in the message, much like how embedded images and gifs work. 

### UserBG
Updated version of AAGaming's UserBG plugin. This plugin allows for the displaying of custom avatar banner backgrounds from USRBG, which lets non nitro users use banners that are only displayable to other people using USRBG's database. If you want to add your own banner background, please read the guide on [USRBG's github page](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg). Please bear in mind that since usrbg's website is overloaded currently, it will take around a minute after launching the plugin for the first time for banners to work-the database will be locally cached afterwards. If you or someone else recently uploaded a banner background to usrbg and you want to see said banners as soon as possible, you must redownload the usrbg database by going in plugin settings and pressing on redownload: this will take around a minute to download and apply. Credits to the USRBG team for creating and maintaining USRBG.
This plugin has also been updated to support [APFP](https://github.com/rmkx/APFP), which allows for animated profile images without nitro. Similarly, if you want to add your own profile picture, read the guide on [APFP's page](https://github.com/rmkx/APFP). Credits to rmkx, p0rtL and others on the APFP team for creating and maintaining APFP.
